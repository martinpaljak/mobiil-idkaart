# Mobile-ID as EstEID over NFC

> Use your **phone** with a [Mobile-ID SIM card](http://mobiil.id.ee/) just **like a regular ID-card** on a PC with [Baastarkvara](https://github.com/martinpaljak/idkaart_public#github-mirror-of-zee-baastarkvara)<sup>*</sup> and a decent contactless reader, thanks to the [Host Card Emulation](http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/connectivity/nfc/hce.html) in the latest Android release. This is like [FakeEstEID](https://github.com/martinpaljak/AppletPlayground/wiki/FakeEstEID) but with real and valid certificates!

You can choose between a 100% faked card (FakeEstEID through [VRE](https://github.com/martinpaljak/vJCRE)) or one backed by Mobile-ID during application startup.
